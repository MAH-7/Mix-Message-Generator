# Mix-Message-Generator
1. Project Objective
The program will generate a random fortune for the user each time it runs, offering a combination of messages in different categories (e.g., future events, advice, lucky numbers).
2. Message Categories
Define multiple categories to create variety in the fortune messages. Examples:
Prediction: What will happen in the future.
Advice: Guidance for the user’s life.
Lucky Numbers: Randomly generated numbers considered "lucky."
Mood: A fortune about the user's emotional state.
3. Message Structure
Prediction: E.g., “You will have great success,” “A challenging time is ahead.”
Advice: E.g., “Stay patient,” “Take bold actions.”
Lucky Numbers: E.g., A set of 3 or 5 randomly generated numbers.
Mood: E.g., “You will feel energetic,” “A period of calm is coming.”
4. Data Design
Store the possible messages for each category in arrays or objects:
An array for each category with multiple possible outcomes.
Example data structure:
predictions = ["You will find great fortune", "An unexpected journey awaits", "Challenges will test your resolve"]
advice = ["Trust your instincts", "Stay positive", "Think before you act"]
luckyNumbers = Function to generate random numbers.
5. Random Selection Logic
Create a function to randomly pick one message from each category.
Use JavaScript's random function (Math.random() and Math.floor()) to choose a random index from each category array.
For the lucky numbers, generate random numbers within a certain range.
6. Output Format
The generated message will combine one message from each category to form a complete fortune. For example:
"Prediction: You will have great success."
"Advice: Stay positive."
"Lucky Numbers: 7, 13, 22."
"Mood: You will feel energetic."
7. Optional Enhancements
Add more categories to make the fortunes more interesting.
Store the generated fortunes and allow the user to review previous fortunes.
Include thematic elements like zodiac signs or tarot cards to enrich the fortunes.
8. Testing
Test the program by running it multiple times to ensure the fortunes are varied and logically formatted.
